* Ethereum JSON Keystore Password Recovery

If you know all of the possible component parts of your password, this script will generate all
combinations and permutations of them using =combinate.py=, and attempt to open the provided JSON
keystore file (optionally, with the specified number of parallel threads).

** EXAMPLES

For example, lets say that you know that your password was some combination of several words, but
you don't know which ones or in what order.  Lets compute all permutations/combinations, and attempt
recovery using 8 thread:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
$ pip3 install -r requirements.txt
$ ./combinate.py horse stable correct battery mouse  | ./attempt.py keystore/*.test 8
